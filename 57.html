    <h1>Friday, April 12, 2019</h1>
    <h2>57 days to go</h2>
    How is it that one of the best dinners we've ever had was for our first anniversary? I mean, I guess the fact that it's so hard to top isn't because we haven't had anything good. We just happened to have an amazing meal pretty early in our relationship.<br><br>
    And look at those swanky 23-year-old kids in that photo! So in love! Although even then, I don't think we could've known for sure that we'd eventually be marrying each other. We've come so far, and yet in a lot of ways we're still the same couple we've always been.<br><br>
    Love,<br><br>
    Michael
