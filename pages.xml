    <para>How to Get Away with Murder has been appointment viewing for us almost as long as we've been dating. If that episode last night was the last one, then what a ride it's been! First I loved that show, then I kinda liked it, then I hated it, then I was like "Whaaat?", then I loved it again, then I was "eh" about it, then I hated it, and now… well… now how do we feel?</para>

    <para>I hope your electric blanket has brought you lots of warmth and happiness. You look so cute snuggled up under it! Though I do still feel a little bad for Lamb Chop the Llama.</para>
