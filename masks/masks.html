        <p id="firstp">February 15, 2014, the most important day of my life, is six years in the past. I've lived 21 percent of my life since that day, which sounds like a lot, but somehow it doesn't feel like nearly enough. The other 79 percent doesn't make sense to me anymore—it feels so distant, so foreign.</p>
        <p>At least I can now say that for 21 percent of my life, I've been complete. I always imagined true love before I met you, but I never knew what it would feel like. After six years of experience in love, the best words I could use to describe it are: ever-present, all-encompassing, occasionally messy, and completely euphoric.</p>
        <p>Loving you makes me love my past for leading me to you. I'm sure that by some crazy butterfly effect, if you took away one of my embarrassing kindergarten moments we never would have met, so every last bit was worth it.</p>
        <p>I can't believe my luck that the stars aligned like they did. You are such a beautiful person, in every sense of the word, and you bring so much joy to my life. I'm still in awe that you chose me as your partner, but it's a privilege and an honor to be that person for you. I'm so excited for our next journey, whatever it may be, because life with you is the best life!
        <p style="text-align: center">---</p>
        <p>Take a minute to think about the fact that we've been together for six whole years. Think about how long that is. Go back six years before we met, and we were juniors in high school. I don't know what I was doing on February 15, 2008, but I know that I was an unstylish mess of a teenager.</p>
        <p>Just as we matured over those six years, I think we've matured in the last six years too. But we're still the same people we've always been, figuring this whole thing out together. We give our love to each other every day, and I can't imagine anything more beautiful than the companionship, comfort, and support that comes with a loving relationship.</p>
        <p>I love you Lisa. I love you so much, and I will never stop loving you no matter what. Even though we're married now, this will always be a special day for us because it's the day our love story began.</p>
        <p>I wanted to take a brief look back at the last six years and all the great times we've had along the way, because that's just what I do. Just keep scrolling and I'll do the talking!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year1" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 1</h1>
        <p>Look at these cuties! We were just a couple of kids in love.</p>
        <p>Meeting you, getting to know you, and falling in love with you was the greatest adventure I've ever had. Is there anything more exciting and nerve-wracking? I never would have guessed that my special someone was right around the corner, but it didn't take too long to figure out.</p>
        <p>From the (many) online messages, to the first date that moved from Little Goat to De Cero, to every magic moment and awkward stumble, it was a truly unforgettable time in our lives. And yes, we were young when we met, but that just means we've been able to spend more of our lives together. We're still only 28, and we've already got six wonderful years in the books!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year2" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 2</h1>
        <p>This was the year we ran a half-marathon, went to Minneapolis, kayaked in the river (trash and all), went to our first wedding together, and celebrated Laura's 21st birthday.</p>
        <p>Things were pretty serious by this point, as we had separate apartments but were spending most of our time together. Life in Lakeview feels like a completely different time, but I loved going to Pizza Rustica, jogging to the harbor, and everything about the janky Sheridan station.</p>
        <p>We spent our second anniversary on a staycation at the CAA Hotel. There were some great moments in that weekend—watching you try to play bocce in heels, writing love letters on a typewriter, having Cindy's all to ourselves—it was a perfect little retreat. Too bad they wised up and realized what a steal they gave us.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year3" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 3</h1>
        <p>The summer of 2016 was dedicated to running. We ran hundreds of miles and raised thousands of dollars leading up to the Chicago Marathon and ran the whole 26.2 in 5 hours, 2 minutes, 57 seconds. (Laura made a pretty good sign too.)</p>
        <p>That marathon is one of the things I'm most proud of. We pushed ourselves and each other through long runs, early mornings, and battles against dehydration. And when we finally made it to the end, we crossed the finish line hand in hand. How great is that?</p>
        <p>We also took two of my absolute favorite trips, to Seattle and Mexico City. We couldn't have asked for better weather in either city, and we did the tasting menu at one of the best restaurants in the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year4" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 4</h1>
        <p>It was a year of milestones—I finished grad school and returned to the working world, we moved into a swanky apartment in Old Town, and we capped the whole thing off by getting engaged!</p>
        <p>The proposal brought a close to Chapter 1 and started an exciting new phase of our lives. We spent four years as "boyfriend and girlfriend", and a year and a half as "fiancé and fiancée", and now we're "husband and wife". It feels weird sometimes that our titles will never change again, but I also take comfort in the permanence of it. I smile whenever I hear you say the word "husband", because I think about what that permanence means and how far we've come to get to this point.</p>
        <p>That summer, we took a weekend trip Galena as a graduation gift, and then we took a helicopter for my birthday. (You really outdid yourself with the experiences this year.)</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year5" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 5</h1>
        <p>We spent this entire year engaged and planning our wedding, which did take a lot of work. But there was also a lot of fun work, like all the vendor visits we got to go on—to see venues, eat free meals, taste free cakes, and meet with interesting people. We took some great engagement photos, and we spent a lot of time counting down the days until June 8, 2019.</p>
        <p>We also went to a <i>lot</i> of weddings leading up to our own. Steve & Jess, Emmy & Griffin, Janine & Brett, Gina & Matt, and Vethina & Brandon all got married in Year 5. (And Michael & Rae got married the next May.) Celebrating all those couples was a blast, and we learned a lot of things that we could apply to our own wedding. Plus I got to sharpen my skills on the dancefloor!</p>
        <p>It wasn't all wedding talk, though. We took in some of the most beautiful nature I've ever seen, in the Icelandic countryside and the Rocky Mountains. We sipped beers on the Milwaukee riverfront, and I joined in your family's traditions in Door County. And our fifth anniversary was a fancy dinner at S.K.Y. followed by a relaxing weekend at my dad's new house in Michigan.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year6" class="yearsec">
        <h1>Year 6</h1>
        <p>So what's happened in the last year? We went to New York and Toronto, had a couple bridal showers, got a car, saw Julie Andrews and Michael Bublé, went to a USWNT match, and were in the Lights Festival parade. We saw Dear Evan Hansen, Six, Hamilton, and Mean Girls, and we went to the James Beard Awards. We went on an amazing trip to Thailand and Singapore.</p>
        <p>...Oh, and WE GOT MARRIED!</p>
        <p>We poured our hearts and souls into our wedding, and the result was just perfect. I don't know how one day could ever possibly be better, and I'm going to cherish it for all of the days that follow. I loved all the personal touches we put on it, all the great people we shared it with, and every single moment that I spent next to you.</p>
        <p>On that day, I promised my love to you forever. You are the most important part of my life, and you always will be. All I want is to be the best partner that I can be, and to make you happy. You deserve nothing less than that, and I want you to know how much you mean to me. I know you already know, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop saying it.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year7" class="yearsec">
        <p>As I look back on the entire timeline of our relationship, I see so many major events and big changes that we've been through together. But it's not those things that make me love you. So often those are testaments to, and celebrations of, our love, but my love comes from all of those gaps in the timeline.</p>
        <p>I love that you bought us matching red and white striped onesies to wear during the holidays. It's totally ridiculous, which is how I know it was a great idea.</p>
        <p>I love that we take weird selfies on each other's phones, and how much you laugh when I'm laughing really hard. I love that you actually recorded a video of me laughing.</p>
        <p>I love that when we see a really good musical you listen to the soundtrack on loop for weeks afterward. I love that face you make when you see a really cute dog, and how you stop in your tracks and grab my arm.</p>
        <p>I love the way you smile at me right after you wake up, with your messy hair. I love that you get tipsy after one drink and drunk after two. I love how many pictures you take, and how you physically cannot walk into Anthropologie without taking a lap around the whole store.</p>
        <p>These are the kind of things you won't see in a highlight reel, but they're more important to me. And to think that I'm fortunate enough to get a lifetime of all these little things. We didn't make it to each of these anniversaries because of all the stuff we did, but because we get fulfillment out of doing all of this together—whether it's an exciting vacation, or cooking dinner.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="year8" class="yearsec" style="margin-bottom: 0">
        <p>So, I guess that puts us in Year 7. Can you believe that?</p>
        <p>I think it's going to be another great year for us. Whatever the future holds, I feel ready for it knowing that we'll be by each other's side through it all. I believe in the power of our love, and I'm excited to start another year of life with you!</p>
        <p>Happy 6th First Date Anniversary, Lisa!</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p id="lastp">Michael</p>
