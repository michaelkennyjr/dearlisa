    <h1>Friday, February 15, 2019</h1>
    <h2>113 days to go</h2>
    Happy Anniversary, Lisa!<br><br>
    It's hard to believe we've been together for five years. I look back at old pictures of us from way back in 2014, and I realize that I've spent half a decade spinning in this whirlwind. In a flash, I went from wondering when I would find love to being in a relationship with the woman that I'd eventually spend the rest of my life with.<br><br>
    It's pretty crazy when you think about it. I know online dating wasn't quite as easy for you, but I think back to the person I was on New Year's Day 2014 and I wonder what I would have said if you had told me that I was less than a month away from sending a message to my wife. It just goes to show that seemingly small decisions can change our lives instantly, even if we don't realize it at the time.<br><br>
    I know I talk a lot about my perspectives about time&mdash;what feels fast, what feels slow, what feels close up or far away&mdash;but after five years, I feel like I've known you my whole life. We're such important parts of each others' lives, and we fit together so well, that life before you and life without you just don't make sense anymore. Whenever I catch myself thinking about my past, I remember that if I went back and changed any one thing, I wouldn't even know you. So everything before February 15, 2014 is completely off-limits.<br><br>
    We've known for a long time that we're in love, but that feeling still makes me giggle like a little kid. I have someone I can spend every day with, and I'm far more in love with you than I was one, two, three, four years ago. I'm still excited to see you when we get home, and I'm still sad to see you go when you leave.<br><br>
    Year Five brought its own challenges, as every year does, but we keep getting stronger as we face challenges together. Getting through the wedding planning process hasn't been easy, but we're going to come out on the other side communicating better, and I'm getting better at staying on task and knocking things out when I can. There are issues that frustrate us, but we work to move past the bad feelings and support each other.<br><br>
    Now we're just 113 days from getting married. As much fun as it is to plan this big event, go meet with all the vendors, and envision what the day will be like, all I care about is putting that ring on your finger, and having you put one on mine. I decided long ago that I was ready to make a lifelong commitment to you, doing my best to support you and make you happy. There's nothing I want more in the entire world than to call you my wife, and to be the best husband that I can be.<br><br>
    Unfortunately, even though 113 days have passed since we got engaged, this 113 days seems like it's going to feel especially long. Since we still have quite a bit of waiting to do, I wanted to create something that you can enjoy from now until our wedding day. These are the days that will bridge two phases of our life&mdash;we'll always celebrate February 15, but in future years June 8 is going to be our anniversary.<br><br>
    So, until we reach that joyous, beautiful, monumental occasion, come back to dear-lisa.com every day, and there will be a new picture and message waiting for you. Consider them love letters from your soon-to-be husband!<br><br>
    Happy anniversary, Lisa. I love you so much, and I can't wait to count down to our wedding together.<br><br>
    Love,<br><br>
    Michael
