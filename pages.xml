      <para>I love that you love to travel as much as I do. Travel is one of the first things we connected over, and you've been to so many amazing places. I hope you don't mind going back to all of them, because I want to go everywhere with you!</para>

      <para>I forget sometimes how many different places we've been to together. I think of a place like Pittsburgh, and how I never would have imagined loving that city as much as I did. The first time we went to visit Vethina and Brandon, I was floored by some of the views up in the mountains looking down on the high-rises downtown.  Just one more fascinating experience that I got to share with you!</para>

      <para>There are only 68 days left until 6/8! Can you believe it?</para>
      <para>I am so ready to be married to you. I don't know about you, but I've been dreaming about 6/8 for a long time. And not just getting married, but getting married to you. I'm going to be walking around with a ring on my finger, showing it off to everyone because it's a symbol of the fact that I have you as my life partner! How amazing is that? I think I might have the people at work start calling me Lisa's husband.</para>
      <para>I'm not prepared to wait 68 more days, but I'll do what I must to get to that day. Celebrating with you is going to be incredible. I already get misty-eyed just thinking about it sometimes. I LOVE YOU!</para>
      <ps>P.S. ... April Fool's.</ps>

      <para>You're adorable when you go home and see Blizzard. It's always funny watching you shower him with love while he looks angry and disinterested. (I know he really loves you though.)</para>

      <para>I have so much admiration for you and the relationship you've established with Nariah. You bring moments of positivity and fun to a child's life and give her a positive influence. You can't change the world, but you can make a difference, and I'm so proud of you for doing that.</para>
